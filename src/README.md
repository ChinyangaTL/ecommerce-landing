# Frontend Mentor - E-commerce product page solution

This is a solution to the [E-commerce product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

This was merely a stepping stone to get a proper react version working before I implement the same solution using TypeScript.
It must be stated that I didn't care much to recreate an exact duplicate of the project, especially CSS-wise. Just to get a working React app that implements useContext and useReducer to produce the solution.

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

I did not attempt the 'Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image' part of the project, mostly because that is a lot of CSS I do not want to deal with in my inebirated state. Who knows, i might get to it sometime. Probably not tbh.
